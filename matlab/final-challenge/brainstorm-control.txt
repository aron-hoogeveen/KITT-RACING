REQUIREMENTS / INFORMATION OF THE TASK(S)
The system should be autonomous. At the start of the challenge the position 
as well as the orientation of KITT is known. The FIRST TASK is to drive 
from the starting point to the end point. The SECOND TASK is to drive from 
the starting point to an intermediate point and then to the end point. 
The points are all at least 1.5 meter seperated from each other. KITT must 
stop for at least 2 seconds at the intermediate point and signal in the 
user interface that it has reached the intermediate point. The user 
interface should include a plot which visualizes the past and current 
positions. 
Bonus points are given to the fastest team. 


COMPONENTS
- matrix, which resembles the field in which KITT drives;
- plot, in which can be seen where KITT has been, and where it now is;
- localization / TDOA, which returns the distances that KITT is from the 
  microphones;
- control, which is the main script that merges all components together. 
- driveControl, which is used to determine which action the car should 
  take;


DRIVING THROUGH THE FIELD
- the maximum distance between two adjadent points is 1.5 meter. This is 
  possibly larger than the turning ration of KITT, so it is most likely 
  that KITT can reach every next point by only taking a turn while driving;
- an exception on this, is when KITT ends up with its front bumper 
  orientating close to the edge of the field. In this case KITT should 
  drive backwards until it can make the turn to get to the next waypoint 
  without leaving the field.
- it is of course possible to let KITT also drive in reverse. Why limit 
  KITT into driving only forwards? In some situations it could be faster or 
  easier to just drive in reverse to the next point.


WHAT TO MEASURE
x angles of the wheels for different steering commands
- turning ratio for the different steering angles driving forward (also at 
  different speeds)
- turning ratio for the different steering angles driving backwards (also 
  at different speeds)


POSSIBLE GLITCHES THAT SHOULD BE PREVENTED
- KITT is not able to get a specific point and keeps driving in circles 
  around that point(s).
- KITT drives out of the field.
